# How React and Typescript works under the hood

This is my study notes about React and how it works under the hood. 

I will test some implementations of React and show to my friends how it works.

## How to run

```bash
# Install dependencies  
yarn install
````

# Build

```bash
# Build the project
yarn build
# Or
npx tsc index2.tsx --jsx react-jsx
```

# Run

There is no runner, just testing the compilation.
