# Never

The never type represents a value that never occurs. It is used to indicate that a function will not return normally or that a variable cannot have any valid value. For example, if a function always throws an error or enters an infinite loop, its return type can be never.

# Void

The void type is used to indicate that a function does not return any value. It is essentially used for functions that have no return statement or have a return statement without any explicit value. Functions with a void return type can return undefined, but they cannot return any other value.

# Unknown

The unknown type is used to represent values whose type the compiler cannot determine. It is a safer alternative to any because it requires type checking and explicit type assertion before being used. This enforces better type safety in TypeScript code.

# Any

The any type is the most flexible type in TypeScript. When a variable is declared with the any type, it can hold values of any type, and TypeScript doesn't perform any type-checking on it. This means that using any essentially opts out of TypeScript's static type checking, which can lead to potential type-related errors at runtime.
